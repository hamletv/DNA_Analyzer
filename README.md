# DNA_Analyzer
DNA Analyzer to compare sample DNA (found) and suspect DNA (provided).

DNA (Deoxyribonucleid Acid) is a protein found in all humans, in our cells. It is our biological fingerprint that identifies us for good or bad within millions of others. 
Like fingerprints but with exponentially greater accuracy our DNA can clear us or incriminate us of criminal activity, if treated properly and with adequate testing.

This tool reads provided DNA samples, slices it into codons and runs it against sample DNA codons to determine if there is a match.
